# TICKET-104: Card Management Events Implementation

## Description
This ticket has been split into two more focused tickets:
- TICKET-107: Ingredient Removal System ("Fridge Cleanup")
- TICKET-108: Ingredient Addition System ("Ingredient Acquisition")

Please refer to those tickets for implementation details.

## Tasks
- Coordinate implementation between TICKET-107 and TICKET-108
- Ensure proper sequence flow between the two systems
- Verify consistency in UI design and functionality across both systems

## Acceptance Criteria
- Both card management systems work together seamlessly
- The removal system (TICKET-107) transitions properly to the addition system (TICKET-108)
- UI design and user flow is consistent between both systems
- Both systems are completed before the next customer arrives

## Additional Notes
- This ticket now serves primarily as coordination between the two more detailed tickets
- Refer to TICKET-107 and TICKET-108 for detailed implementation requirements
