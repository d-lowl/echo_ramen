# TICKET-106: Boss Encounters Implementation

## Description
Implement the two boss encounters for the final floor of the game as described in the GDD. These boss customers ("The Food Critic" and "Chef Neuromancer") feature unique mechanics that challenge the player's deck-building strategy and provide a climactic conclusion to the game.

## Tasks
- Create the boss floor system with two special customers
- Implement "The Food Critic" boss with:
  - Unique visual appearance and character design
  - "Refined Palate" mechanic that changes preferred attributes mid-service
  - Higher difficulty level (4) with demanding attribute requirements
  - Special UI indicators for changing preferences
  - Victory reward (signature ingredient with attribute adjustment ability)
- Implement "Chef Neuromancer" boss with:
  - Unique visual appearance and character design
  - "Neural Recipe Network" mechanic that adapts to player's ingredient choices
  - Higher difficulty level (4) with adaptive challenge
  - Special UI indicators for learning/adaptation
  - Victory reward (AI Assistant effect for prediction)
- Create boss introduction sequence and narrative elements
- Implement game completion state after defeating both bosses

## Acceptance Criteria
- Boss floor correctly loads after completing the third floor
- "The Food Critic" has unique appearance and dialogue
- "Refined Palate" mechanic changes preferences during service with clear indicators
- "Chef Neuromancer" has unique appearance and dialogue
- "Neural Recipe Network" mechanic adapts to counter player strategy
- Boss difficulty level is appropriately challenging (level 4)
- Victory rewards are implemented and functional
- Defeating both bosses triggers game completion state
- Boss encounters provide adequate feedback on special mechanics

## Additional Notes
- Consider adding special music and visual effects for boss encounters
- Boss interactions should enhance the cyberpunk narrative theme
- Ensure boss mechanics are clearly communicated to the player
- Boss encounters should feel climactic but still balanced
- Consider adding narrative elements that tie into the cyberpunk setting
- Refer to the GDD for detailed descriptions of the boss mechanics
- Consider implementing a tutorial hint for first-time boss encounters
