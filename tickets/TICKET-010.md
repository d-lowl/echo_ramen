# TICKET-010: Create ingredient token visualization system

## Description
Develop a visual system to represent ingredients as interactive tokens with cyberpunk styling. The tokens should clearly communicate ingredient properties, effects, and allow for intuitive player interaction during gameplay.

## Tasks
- Design ingredient token visual template with cyberpunk aesthetic
- Create visual representations for each ingredient type
- Implement attribute effect visualization on tokens
- Add visual states for tokens (available, selected, used, special effect)
- Develop token interaction animations (select, drag, combine)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each ingredient has a unique and recognizable visual token
- Tokens clearly display ingredient attributes and effects
- Visual design follows cyberpunk aesthetic with neon/holographic styling
- Tokens support different visual states based on game state
- Tokens provide clear feedback when interacted with
- Tokens are visually consistent but distinguishable between ingredient types
