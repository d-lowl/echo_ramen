# TICKET-105: Floor End Random Events

## Description
Implement the three random events that trigger at the end of each floor as described in the GDD. These events (Quantum Fusion Lab, Black Market Dealer, and Cybernetic Enhancement) each provide the player with two opposing strategic options that can significantly impact their deck composition and strategy.

## Tasks
- Create a random event selection system that triggers at floor completion
- Implement the Quantum Fusion Lab event with two options:
  - Fusion: Combine two thirds of the deck randomly pairwise
  - Crossover: Crossover two thirds of the deck randomly pairwise
- Implement the Black Market Dealer event with two options:
  - Risk Deal: Add three powerful but flawed ingredients
  - Safe Deal: Remove up to three ingredients and receive stable replacements
- Implement the Cybernetic Enhancement event with two options:
  - Amplification: Boost positive effects by 25%, intensify negative effects by 25%
  - Stabilization: Reduce positive effects by 25%, reduce negative effects by 50%
- Create UI for presenting random events and their options
- Implement effects of each option on the player's deck
- Create transitions between random event and next floor

## Acceptance Criteria
- One random event is triggered at the end of each floor
- Each event presents two strategic options with clear descriptions
- The Quantum Fusion Lab correctly combines or crosses over cards
- The Black Market Dealer correctly implements both risk and safe deals
- The Cybernetic Enhancement correctly applies attribute modifications
- UI clearly shows the potential impact of each option
- Player must choose one option before proceeding to the next floor
- Chosen option is immediately applied to the deck
- Event results are visually communicated to the player

## Additional Notes
- Random events should not occur after the boss floor
- Consider implementing unique visual and audio styles for each event
- Ensure the UI clearly communicates the permanent effect of choices
- Add tooltips or previews to help players understand the impact of their choices
- Refer to the GDD for detailed descriptions of the random events
- Consider adding character dialogue to enhance the narrative aspect of events
