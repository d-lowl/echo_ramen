# TICKET-003: Implement attribute system

## Description
Create the core attribute system for Ramen Balance Master that will track and calculate the three main attributes: Richness, Spiciness, and Sweetness. This system will be fundamental to the gameplay mechanics and will be used to evaluate how well a player's recipe matches customer requests.

## Tasks
- Create data structures to represent the three main attributes (Richness, Spiciness, Sweetness)
- Implement methods to calculate attribute values based on ingredients
- Create opposing attribute pairs (Richness vs. Lightness, Spiciness vs. Mildness, Sweetness vs. Savory)
- Develop attribute calculation engine to determine final recipe values
- Implement attribute comparison system to evaluate match with customer requests

## Acceptance Criteria
- Attributes can be modified by adding/removing ingredients
- Attribute calculations correctly balance opposing values
- System accurately tracks current recipe attribute state
- Attribute values are bounded within meaningful ranges (e.g., 0-10)
- Comparison logic correctly determines match percentage between recipe and customer request
