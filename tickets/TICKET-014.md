# TICKET-014: Implement 3 special effects

## Description
Develop and implement three special ingredient effects that provide unique gameplay mechanics beyond standard attribute modifications. These effects will add strategic depth and variety to the recipe creation process.

## Tasks
- Design and implement "Neural Enhancement" effect (enhance next ingredient)
- Design and implement "Quantum Duplication" effect (double effect)
- Design and implement "Negative Ion Cancellation" effect (cancel negative effects)
- Create visual feedback for each special effect
- Implement triggering and activation mechanics

## Special Effects to Implement
1. **Neural Enhancement**: Enhances the attribute effects of the next ingredient used by 50%
2. **Quantum Duplication**: Doubles the attribute effects of a selected ingredient
3. **Negative Ion Cancellation**: Removes negative attribute effects from the current recipe

## Acceptance Criteria
- All three special effects are properly implemented
- Effects correctly modify recipe attributes as defined
- Visual feedback clearly communicates when effects are active
- Effect targeting works correctly (where applicable)
- Effects are balanced and provide meaningful strategic choices
- Special effect ingredients are visually distinct from basic ingredients
