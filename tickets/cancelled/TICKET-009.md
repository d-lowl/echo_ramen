# TICKET-009: Design and implement attribute sliders with visual feedback

## Description
Create an intuitive UI system with sliders to visualize the three main attributes of a ramen recipe (Richness, Spiciness, Sweetness). The sliders should update in real-time as ingredients are added and provide clear visual feedback on how well the current recipe matches customer requests.

## Tasks
- Design holographic-style attribute sliders with cyberpunk aesthetic
- Implement slider visualization component
- Create system to update sliders based on current recipe attributes
- Add visual indicators for target attribute values from customer requests
- Implement match/mismatch visualization to show how well current values match targets

## Acceptance Criteria
- Sliders visually represent current recipe attribute values
- Sliders update in real-time when recipe changes
- Target values from customer requests are clearly indicated
- Visual feedback shows how close current values are to targets
- Design follows cyberpunk aesthetic with neon/holographic styling
- Sliders are responsive and work on different screen sizes
