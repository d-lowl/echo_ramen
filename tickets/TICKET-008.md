## Description
Implement a system to process and apply special effects from ingredients with unique abilities. This includes effects like "Neural Enhancement" (enhance next ingredient), "Quantum Duplication" (double effect), and other special abilities described in the GDD.

## Tasks
- Create effect processor system to handle various special abilities
- Implement effect triggers and activation conditions
- Develop effect visualization and feedback
- Create targeting system for effects that modify other ingredients
- Implement duration tracking for temporary effects

## Acceptance Criteria
- Special ingredient effects correctly modify recipe attributes
- Effects that target other ingredients work properly
- Temporary effects expire at appropriate times
- Visual feedback clearly communicates active effects
- Effect combinations interact correctly
- System handles all special effect types defined in the GDD
