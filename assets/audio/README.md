# Audio Assets for Customer Satisfaction Feedback

This directory should contain the following audio files for the customer satisfaction feedback system:

## Required Audio Files

1. `satisfaction-ecstatic.mp3` - Cheerful jingle/celebration sound for perfect matches (90-100%)
2. `satisfaction-satisfied.mp3` - Happy tone for good matches (70-89%)
3. `satisfaction-neutral.mp3` - Neutral tone for acceptable matches (50-69%)
4. `satisfaction-dissatisfied.mp3` - Disappointed tone for poor matches (30-49%)
5. `satisfaction-disgusted.mp3` - Negative feedback sound for terrible matches (0-29%)

## Audio Guidelines

- Audio files should be in MP3 or OGG format
- Keep file sizes small (preferably under 100KB each)
- Audio duration should be short (1-2 seconds)
- Sounds should fit the cyberpunk theme
- Volume levels should be consistent across all files

## Implementation Note

Until actual sound files are added, the game will display a console warning when trying to play these sounds but will continue to function properly with visual feedback.
